totalHeight 60.0 ; Total height of the print
filamentDiameter 1.75 ; Diameter of the filament
firstLayerHeight 0.20 ; Height of the first layer. Height of the brim if it's the case.
bedTemperature 80 ; Temperature of the bed during printing
brimCount 5 ; Number of brim lines. Set to 0 if you don't want a brim.
zSpeed 10 ; Rate of Z axis movements
minRetractDistance 1.0 ; Minimum distance to consider a retract
fanStartHeight 0.6 ; The print height at which the fanStart parameter will be considered.


; The parameter without Start of Finish on it's name is used at the start
; of the print (setup, brim etc).
; The other values are used as values that are linearly varied from the start 
; to the finish of the print.
; For a value not to be varied during print, set all three parameters to the
; same value.

; Speed of the part cooling fan.
; This value is given in 0 to 255 format.
; It's usual to not use fan on the first layers so let 'fan' equal zero even
; if you want another value right after the first layers. 
; Unless you know what you're doing, of course.
