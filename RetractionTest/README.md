# RetractionTest

The config.txt and pattern.txt files in this folder can be used as input files on TestPrint.exe to generate a "retraction test" object suitable to find optimal retraction length for a specific setup (material, printer etc).

The same test could be run, for example, at various fan speeds to see the influence of the cooling fan on stringing as well as layer adhesion, overall finishing, precision, etc.
