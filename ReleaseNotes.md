# v0.2-alpha
18-OCTOBER-2020


## Issues Patched

* Mostly code cleanup and some small corrections.

* It's now recommended that the figure in pattern.txt forms a closed shape. This makes more overall sense and makes it easier for the workings of the code that generates the object. Please see the included pattern.txt files.

* The pattern.txt and config.txt files on the main project folder are set to create a temperature tower suitable for ABS like materials. No cooling fan, temperature starting at 260 °C and going down to 200 °C at the end of the print.

* Updated files on TemperatureTowerABS and TemperatureTowerPLA folders.

## New Features

* None important enough.

## Known Issues

* The brim generator is not smart enough. Something needs to be done about it.
